# InfoSessions and InfoSessionsArchive Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Cannot Edit InfoSessionsArchive Table
**Problem**: The InfoSessionsArchive table was missing from the `allowed_tables` list in several route functions, preventing users from performing edit operations on archived sessions.

**Root Cause**: Multiple functions had `allowed_tables = ['InfoSessions', 'Interviews', 'Employers']` but didn't include `'InfoSessionsArchive'`.

**Functions Fixed**: 
- `editor()` - line ~163
- `add_row()` - line ~183  
- `editor_wizard()` - line ~215
- `advanced_editor()` - line ~256
- `download_template()` - line ~264
- `upload_csv()` - line ~295
- `preview_csv()` - line ~331
- `delete_mode()` - line ~455

**Fix Applied**: Added `'InfoSessionsArchive'` to the `allowed_tables` list in all these functions.

### Issue 2: Dates Switching to 1900-01-01 in Archive
**Problem**: When editing InfoSessionsArchive records, dates were being converted to 1900-01-01 due to improper handling of date objects in the `clean_value()` function.

**Root Cause**: The `clean_value()` function was converting all values to strings first (`val = str(val).strip()`), which caused issues when date and time objects from the database were processed. When a `datetime.date` object was converted to a string and then parsed back, it could fail and return `None`, which might get converted to a default date.

**Fix Applied**: Updated the `clean_value()` function to:
1. Handle `datetime.date` objects directly without converting to string first
2. Handle `datetime.datetime` objects by extracting the date part
3. Handle `datetime.time` objects directly for time columns
4. Added more robust date parsing with multiple format attempts
5. Improved error handling to prevent `None` values from becoming invalid dates

## Changes Made

### File: `app.py`

1. **Updated `allowed_tables` lists** in 8 different route functions to include `'InfoSessionsArchive'`

2. **Enhanced `clean_value()` function**:
   - Added early handling for date objects before string conversion
   - Added early handling for time objects before string conversion  
   - Improved date parsing with multiple format attempts
   - Better handling of `datetime.date` and `datetime.datetime` objects

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ You should be able to edit InfoSessionsArchive table records using the edit row feature
2. ✅ Dates should maintain their correct values when editing archived sessions
3. ✅ The application should handle date and time data more robustly across all tables

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test editing a record in the InfoSessionsArchive table
2. Verify that dates remain correct after editing
3. Test archiving new sessions to ensure the process still works correctly
4. Verify that other tables (InfoSessions, Interviews, Employers) still work as expected

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and improve the robustness of date/time handling throughout the application.

Hello! I am not sure how or why you ended up here, but you probably have your reasons.

This is a Python app that runs Flask routes to connect an HTML webpage to an Azure SQL database deployment.

I am hoping that this will streamline a variety of office processes, including info session/interview scheduling and tracking. We often have difficulties with keeping all of our info
sessions straight, so a central database that can supply our documents seems like a good idea. It may also be a good idea to store historical data about companies here so that we can
run analysis on our own data without the need for offline Handshake exports.

The SQL database is hosted under my personal account in Azure's free tier, which permits 32GB of storage. This should be plenty to hold all of the text data in the tables. If more is
needed, someone will probably have to contact me at williamvott@gmail.com for information on billing.

I can set up additional querying privileges on the database, so if you would like to populate your Excel sheets from the table, let me know.

I am working on several parts of this project:
  1. Filling the database with company data
  2. Making the front-end website look nice
  3. Optimizing the user-experience to be simple and intuitive
  4. Ensuring access to all users and prioritizing availability
  5. Seamlessly connecting the database to front-end

This project likely will be completed by late August 2025, but it may be put on hold until August 2026 depending on what happens.
